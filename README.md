App for finding out restaurants within an outcode.

To run:

1. bundle install
2. bundle exec rackup
3. localhost:9292
4. Enter outcode and submit to view results

The task is to create an application that accepts an outcode as a parameter. The application should then display the following information about each restaurant that delivers to that outcode by querying our API:

1. Name
2. Rating
3. Types of food for the restaurant
